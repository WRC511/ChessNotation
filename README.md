HW10 WarmUp Notes:
In every software project, dividing work into individual responsibilities is challenging. However,
it is extremely important that everyone contribute to the code base every week. Thus, every
week, each team member has to decide on what their contribution will be. For this week, we
strongly suggest the assigning different people to the two main parts of the app:
1. Part 1. Learning portion (including the home page).
2. Part 2. Quiz portion of the app (including the quiz end page)
   
Within both of these two parts of the app, there are three main tasks
1. Part 1. Learning portion (including the home page). Jobs:
  a. Architecting the data
  b. Implementing the UI
  c. Testing that you can click through the app.
2. Part 2. Quiz portion of the app (including the quiz end page) Jobs:
  a. Architecting the data
  b. Implementing the UI
  c. Testing that you can click through the app.
Although you donâ€™t have to use these exact roles, you do have to establish roles and have
everybody assigned to at least one role.
